# receiptSorter
This project began as an exploration of ways to automate our receipt-handling processes.
We currently manually add receipt details on an Excel Spreadsheet.

### First steps
The Smart Receipts App does a great job of categorizing receipts.

### 5 June '22
Google App Script links receipts to their corresponding entries in Bank Statements. 
-> +5% seen as bank statements are hard to read as a human. 

### 8 June '22
Duplicate receipts detected and signaled to user. 
-> +5% seen as physical receipts are uploaded in no particular order.

### 13 June '22
Tested a Make pipeline to push receipts from my email to Google Drive. 
-> +5% seen as we're currently bottlenecked by one spreadsheet.
